\beginverse
\[Bm]On a dark desert highway, \[F#]cool wind in my hair
\[A]Warm smell of calitas rising \[E]up through the air
\[G]Up ahead in the distance, I \[D]saw a shimmering light
\[Em]My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
\[F#]I had to stop for the night.

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say...
\endverse

\[G] Welcome to the Hotel Cali\[D]fornia
Such a \[F#]lovely place \textit{Such a \[Bm]lovely face}
\[G] Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali\[D]fornia
Any \[Em]time of year, you can \[F#]find it here
\endchorus

\beginverse
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,she got the Mercedes bends
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.

So I called up the Captain:
"Please bring me my wine"
He said: "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
\endverse

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place \textit{Such a lovely face}
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast.

Last thing I remember, I was 
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back 
To the place I was before
"Relax", said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"

% I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
% But I really can't remember when,
% He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
% I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
% He went for his gun and I pulled mine first,
% He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.
% \endverse
% \beginverse
% And he said: "Son, this world is rough
% And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
% And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along.
% So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
% I knew you'd have to get tough or die
% And it's the name that helped to make you strong."
% \endverse
% \beginverse
% He said: "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
% And I know you hate me, and you got the right
% To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
% But ya ought to thank me, before I die,
% For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
% Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you "Sue.'"
% \endverse
% \beginverse
% I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
% And I called him my pa, and he called me his son,
% And I came away with a different point of view.
% And I think about him, now and then,
% Every time I try and every time I win,
% And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
% Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!
